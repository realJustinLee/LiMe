# LiMe

## The Li Xin (Justin Lee) Messenger

LiMe is a communication application implemented in Java that allows you to keep in touch and exchange files with friends
anytime, anywhere. You can also quickly deploy a custom LiMe server for private communication.

## Tech Reviews

- LiMe is developed in the MVC design pattern.
- We use Swing to implement the UI layer.
- The persistence layer is implemented with JDBC.
- As for the database, we chose MySQL.
- The model layer is strictly following JavaBean specification requirements.
- Fully comply with the code specification in the Alibaba Java Coding Guidelines,
- Each layer achieves high cohesion and low coupling, which significantly leverages the scalability and the
  maintainability of this project.
